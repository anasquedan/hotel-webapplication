"# hotel-webapplication" 
This is a web besed application working on spring, I've added some test cases. 
Filtering working properly to order items in available. 

if you want to test the application all you need to run test case or you can run spring application itself and if you want to add crazy or availabile hotel you can do this easily by following this url : POST (localhost:8080/crazyHotel) -> and add requestBody of type crazy hotel , the same for besthotel : (localhost:8080/bestHotel) -< and add requestBody of type bestHotel. 

if you want to retrive ordered value of both providers this is can be done by hit this url (GET localhost:8080/availableHotel
you can do the same to get all dedicated objects of every provider by hit GET http request localhost:8080/crazyHotel , localhost:8080/bestHotel


Feel free to contact me any time.
